## OCI Generative AI Service: Text Generation

**Introduction**<br/>
This project demonstrates the usage of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Generative AI Service for key operation of text generation. By leveraging OCI's powerful AI infrastructure, the project automates NLP tasks such as semantic search and content generation, making it easier to work with text data for various applications.<br/>

**Project Overview**<br/>
Text Generation: Through an API call, we generate human-like text based on a given prompt, enabling content creation, summarization, and more.<br/>

**Purpose**<br/>
The main goal of this project is to automate text processing tasks in data analytics, specifically focusing on:
- Generating meaningful text from raw data or prompts.

**Role**<br/>
- Designed and implemented Python scripts to interact with Oracle Cloud’s Generative AI services.
- Automated text embedding and generation tasks, reducing manual processing efforts.
- Utilized AI-driven insights to enhance business reporting, customer feedback analysis, and automated content generation.<br/>

**Technical Skills**<br/>
- Python: Used for scripting and API interaction with OCI services.
- OCI Generative AI Service: For embedding text and generating coherent, contextual content.
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): Cloud platform where the AI services are hosted and managed.
- APIs: Used to interact with OCI’s Generative AI models.<br/>

**Soft Skills**<br/>
- Problem Solving: Analyzed business problems and developed AI-powered automation solutions to streamline text processing.
- Collaboration: Worked closely with cross-functional teams to implement AI models into real-world applications.
- Adaptability: Leveraged cloud technologies to optimize workflows and improve efficiency.<br/>

**How to Use the Code**<br/>
- **Set Up Your OCI Credentials:**
You will need an [Oracle Cloud account](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/content-cloud/administer/create-and-activate-oracle-cloud-account.html) and [valid API credentials](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#:~:text=To%20generate%20an%20API%20signing%20key%20pair%201,that%20only%20%20you%20can%20view%20it%3A%20) to use these scripts. Ensure that your credentials are stored in the ~/.oci/config file and replace the placeholders in the code.

- **Text Generation:**
Update the prompt and relevant settings (such as token length and temperature) in the text generation code.
- Run the code to generate meaningful responses to your provided prompts.

- **Dependencies:**
Make sure to install the required libraries, such as oci using:
pip install oci
